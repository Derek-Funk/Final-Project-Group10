The train files each correspond to a model, where train_derek_funk_4.py is the script that created my final model. The commented out code will create training, test, and validation folders and copy the images from the zipped folder into these folders.

IF YOU WISH TO RUN FROM SCRATCH AND DO ALL THE PRE-PROCESSING -> run train_derek_funk_4_uncommented.py

IF YOU ALREADY HAVE THE IMAGES PROCESSED IN THEIR RESPECTIVE FOLDERS AND WANT TO RUN JUST MODEL -> run train_derek_funk_4.py
